attemting to create a linechart using MP Android from realtime database

The code i have so far is reading the data that is stored in a firebase realtime database. It is retrieved as hierarchical data so what i want to do should not be too hard.
I am new to java attempting to design my first app in android studio. \

I am attempting to construct a realtime line graph that looks a lot like the PNG file in the repository. So far i have tried the MP Android Graphing but 
i am having difficulties. Would like a live linechart with the date on the x-axis and the "count:#" (from the data) on the y-axis.

Looking for some help on this one. Thank you.
